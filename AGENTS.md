# AGENTS.md

Instructions for AI agents working in the Anticapture monorepo. Read this first,
then consult `CLAUDE.md` (deeper conventions) and the per-package skills in
`.claude/skills/` (mirrored at `.agents/skills/`) for the package you're editing.

## What this is

Anticapture is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo for DAO governance analytics. Blockchain
data is indexed, served as a REST API, aggregated by a REST gateway, consumed through
a generated TypeScript SDK, and rendered in a Next.js dashboard.

## Architecture & data flow

```
PostgreSQL ──┐
             ├─> Indexer (Ponder: writes blockchain data to specific schema on DB,
                      │           creates a view called `anticapture` when finishes indexing)
Ethereum RPC ┘        │
                      v
             API (Hono + Drizzle: reads the `anticapture` view schema on DB, serves REST per DAO)
                      │
                      v
             Gateful (aggregates per-DAO APIs into one REST/OpenAPI surface, :4001)
                      │
                      v
             @anticapture/client (Kubb: generates TS types + React Query hooks
                      │            from Gateful's OpenAPI spec)
                      v
             Dashboard (Next.js frontend, :3000)
```

> The platform is **REST/OpenAPI end-to-end**.
> Data is DAO-scoped via a **path parameter** (e.g. `/{dao}/proposals`), not a header.

## Commands

Run from the repo root. `pnpm <service> <cmd>` filters Turbo to one workspace.

```bash
# Per-service (e.g. pnpm dashboard dev, pnpm gateful dev, pnpm api dev <dao>)
pnpm dashboard <cmd>     # --filter=@anticapture/dashboard
pnpm gateful <cmd>       # --filter=@anticapture/gateful
pnpm api <cmd>           # --filter=@anticapture/api
pnpm client <cmd>        # --filter=@anticapture/client  (codegen | dev | build)
pnpm indexer <cmd>       # --filter=@anticapture/indexer

# Full local stack (orchestrated by scripts/dev.sh)
pnpm dev                 # remote dev APIs
pnpm dev <dao_id>        # also boot a local API for that DAO (e.g. pnpm dev ens)

# Regenerate the client SDK after the Gateful OpenAPI spec changes
pnpm client codegen

# Repo-wide checks
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix
pnpm test
```

### Local startup order

`API → Gateful (:4001) → Client codegen → Dashboard (:3000)`.
Gateful discovers DAO APIs from `DAO_API_<DAO>` env vars; the dashboard reads the
gateway via `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEFUL_URL` (set to `http://localhost:4001` by `pnpm dev`).
See the `local-dev` skill for details.

## Conventions

- **Data fetching (dashboard):** Anticapture data uses `@anticapture/client/hooks`
  (React Query). Pass `daoId.toLowerCase()` cast to the generated `XxxPathParamsDaoEnumKey`
  type as the first (path) argument. Vanilla fetch functions are exported from
  `@anticapture/client` (use in Server Components, sitemap, SEO).
- **Generated code:** never hand-edit files under `packages/anticapture-client/generated/`;
  regenerate with `pnpm client codegen` and commit the result. Use generated types over `any`.
- **Dashboard structure:** Server Components by default; `"use client"` only at interaction
  boundaries. Features are self-contained, no cross-feature imports; shared code lives in `shared/`.
- **Style:** enforced by Prettier + ESLint. Arrow functions; named exports (App Router
  pages are the `export default` exception); inline `type` imports.

## Verification (required before claiming done)

Run typecheck and lint on every affected package; fix all errors before committing.

```bash
pnpm <service> typecheck && pnpm <service> lint   # scoped (preferred)
pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint                        # when changes span packages
```

## Changesets

Every PR to `dev` needs a changeset (`pnpm changeset`) or an empty one
(`pnpm changeset --empty`); the `changeset-check` CI job enforces it. When a change
touches an API OpenAPI contract (`apps/api/openapi/**` or `apps/gateful/openapi/gateful.json`),
also add a `@anticapture/gateful` changeset (enforced by `api-contract-updates.yaml`).
Never hand-edit `version` fields or `CHANGELOG.md` — Changesets owns them.

## Boundaries — never do

- Modify `.env` files containing secrets.
- Force push.
- Remove or skip failing tests without explanation.
- Commit `node_modules`, `.env`, or generated files that aren't meant to be committed.
- Cast types to `any`/`unknown` unless explicitly asked.

## Shared memory (MEMORY.md)

`MEMORY.md` at the repo root is the team's shared agent memory. Reading and updating it is
part of **every task's lifecycle**, not an optional afterthought:

- **Start of a task:** read `MEMORY.md` before digging into an unfamiliar area, so you don't
  relearn what a previous agent already paid for.
- **End of a task (before you finish or open a PR):** ask yourself _"would the next agent or
  human relearn this the hard way?"_ — if yes, append it. Treat this as a required closing step,
  the same as running typecheck/lint.

**Record:** non-obvious constraints and gotchas, the _why_ behind architectural
decisions, recurring pitfalls and their fixes, environment quirks that cost real time.

**Do not record:** session narration, routine work, anything the code or docs already
express, or secrets/tokens of any kind.

Format: append a short factual entry under the matching `##` topic section (create one
if needed), prefixed with the date. Keep entries timeless, verifiable, and one to three
lines — if it needs more, it probably belongs in `docs/` with a pointer here. Prune
entries you can prove stale.

## Where to go deeper

- `CLAUDE.md` — full conventions, changeset/release flow, boundaries.
- `.claude/skills/<package>/` — package-specific guides (`anticapture-api`, `anticapture-gateful`,
  `anticapture-client`, `anticapture-dashboard`, `anticapture-indexer`, `local-dev`,
  `dao-integration`, `testing`, ...).

Fix token holders pagination duplicating rows (wire the shared `getNextPageParam` into `useAccountBalancesInfinite`), unify `getHistoricalBalanceCount` on a single joined query so totals match returned items, memoize delegator dedup, anchor account-interactions `totalCount` to the first page, drop the redundant `fetchNextPageStable` wrapper in `useDelegates`, and document the single-page `limit: 1000` truncation in the balance-history and delegate-delegation-history graph hooks.

### Minor Changes

- [#1875](https://github.com/blockful/anticapture/pull/1875) [`cb90c89`](https://github.com/blockful/anticapture/commit/cb90c8941e32c352ef84eb3b3e45298c1233f4ff) Thanks [@PedroBinotto](https://github.com/PedroBinotto)! - Migrate feed event metadata from a denormalized `feed_event.metadata` JSON column to query-time synthesis against `proposals_onchain`, `votes_onchain`, `delegations`, `transfers`, and `voting_power_history`. Adds discriminated metadata schemas to the OpenAPI contract, supports multi-type filtering on `/feed/events`, and wires the dashboard event-type filter as a multi-select.
